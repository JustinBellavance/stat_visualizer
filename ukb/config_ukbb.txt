# Notes: 
#- UKB coding file as extra commas in some of the text, so it's important to remove all commas before proceeding or else the csv won't be read properly (ParserError)
#- Please ensure the format for your UKB phenotype files are f.<fieldID>.<visit#>.<repeatedmeasurement#> or else the script won't work properly.
